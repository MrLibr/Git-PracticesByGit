Lil Peep & ILoveMakonnen feat. Fall Out Boy – I’ve Been Waiting

Have you ever seen a man this rich?
This broke?
This lost?
In the smoke, please pray for me
I can never hide my ghost come everywhere i go
Tell heaven don't wait for me
Sitting waiting at the gate for me
I heard this bitch blowin LiL Peep faithfully
That's why these pussy's got hate for me
Cause they was busy chasing bitches
I was chasing dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Looking up at em, Like I never even knew them at all
I remember walking around in the hall
And then the bell rang
And i tell there's something that I couldn't recall
Making you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you wan't me too
I'll kill myself, cause I'm already in hell for
You use to love me then
I know it's not the same
But this is not the end, Cause everything gon' change
When i get that Benz, I'ma pullup in the rain
And I'm gon say
You werent
